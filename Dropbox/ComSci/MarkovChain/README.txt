//MarkovChain.java will read in an input text and create a Markov chain by determining the probability that one word will follow another for all words in the input text, then randomly output n words that adhere to the Markov chain.
//The first line of input.txt should be equal to the number of words desired in the input. The remaining lines should contain the text that will be analyzed and mimicked by the program.
//output.txt will contain the randomized output of the program.

//Running instructions:
javac MarkovChain.java
